## AWS

Github, through github actions, updates the image on push. It's automatic, but could fail. So always check for errors first.

Go to EC2, connect to the machine. Check the ip of the instance and keep it update, then run:

```sh
$ docker-compose down # only if it was already running
$ sudo docker system prune -a # to clean local cache
$ sudo docker-compose up -d # run services on deamon mode
```
